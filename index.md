I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Stockholm School of Economics] and the [University of Copenhagen]. 

My main research interests are in health economics and applied microeconomics. I currently work on topics related to physician decision-making and antibiotic prescribing and resistance.

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Copenhagen in 2023. Previously, I was based at the [DIW Berlin Graduate Center]/[Berlin School of Economics], and the [University of Zurich].
