title: "About me"
---


I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Stockholm School of Economics] and the [University of Copenhagen]. 

My main research interests are in health economics. In my work, I use microeconometric methods to study how healthcare can be organized better, explore how we can use technology to provide care, examine physician decision-making, and inform policy-making.

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Copenhagen in 2023. Previously, I was based at the [DIW Berlin Graduate Center]/[Berlin School of Economics], and the [University of Zurich]. 

I am visiting the [Frisch Centre] in Oslo from mid-May to mid-June 2025.
